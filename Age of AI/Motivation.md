The ideal description of the true capabilities of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize situations and tasks and instantly take actions that have the greatest chance of achieving the result of a specific goal.  
  
As a result of continual use and gradual improvement of this development, it turned out that two dominant categories of AI can be tracked:  
  
- Narrow AI: This type of artificial intelligence, sometimes referred to as "weak AI", works in a limited context and is only an imitation of human intelligence. Narrow AI, is often focused on performing tasks in one category efficiently, and while these machines may seem smart, they operate with far more constraints than even a small child.  
  
- Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): AGI, sometimes referred to as "strong AI", is a type of artificial intelligence that we see in movies, like robots from the Western world or data from Star Trek: The Next Generation or the main robot from The Terminator. “AGI is a versatile intelligent machine that, like humans, can use this intelligence to solve any problem.

But an intriguing question arises. After all, everything that happens to a person and inside a person, with the exception of the most ordinary human behavior, is referred to as intelligent actions, and even the most complex behavior of insects is never considered an indicator of intelligence. Then how can you track the presence of this intelligence in a programmed machine?

The pioneer in the study of this issue was the mathematician Alan Turing. Less than ten years after the Nazi encryption machine Enigma hacked and helped the Allied forces win World War II, he changed history for the second time by asking the simple question: "Can machines think?"  
  
Turing's paper Computing Machines and Intelligence (1950) and the subsequent Turing test established the fundamental goal and vision of artificial intelligence.  
  
By that time, AI's only goal was to answer yes to Turing's question. It was then that the first attempt was made to reproduce or simulate human intelligence in machines.  
  
The broad purpose of artificial intelligence has generated many questions and controversies. So much so that the only definition of this field available at that time did become generally unaccepted.  
  
The main limitation in defining AI as "creating intelligent machines" is that it doesn't really explain what is artificial intelligence? What makes a car smart?  
  
In their groundbreaking textbook, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, authors Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig tackle this problem by integrating their work around the topic of intelligent agents in machines. This means AI is "the study of agents who perceive the environment and perform actions." (Russell and Norvig viii). In other words, it is the ability of a machine to perform its actions with the help of special software assistants (agents) that receive and analyze signals transmitted from the external environment.  
  
Norvig and Russell continue exploring four different approaches that have historically defined the realm of AI:  
  
Thinking humanly  
Thinking rationally  
Acting humanly  
Act rationally  
  
The first two ideas are about thought processes and reasoning, while the others are about behavior. Norvig and Russell emphasize the rational components that act to achieve the best result, noting that "all the skills required for the Turing test also allow the agent to act rationally." (Russell and Norvig 4).  
  
While these definitions may seem abstract to the average person, they help focus the field as a field of computer science and provide a blueprint for implementing machines and programs with machine learning and other subsets of artificial intelligence.  
  
Addressing the crowd at the Japan AI Experience 2017, DataRobot CEO Jeremy Achin kicked off his talk with the following definition of how AI is being used today:  
  
"AI is a computer system capable of performing tasks that would normally require human intelligence... Many of these artificial intelligence systems are based on machine learning, some on deep learning, and some on very boring things like rules. "
