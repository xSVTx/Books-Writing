One of the sections of working with artificial intelligence is ==machine learning==, which is directly related to the concept according to which computer programs can automatically learn from new data and then adapt to them without human assistance. Using deep learning techniques allows computer systems to be automatically designed by consuming huge amounts of unstructured data that are beyond the capabilities of the human brain, such as text, images, video, audio, etc.
